                         BucketMap Raleigh 

Project Description : The “Bucket List Raleigh “is a new interactive way the see the city and highlight the most important buildings and structures for you to get the most out of your visit. This is a new personal visual map with local expertise and insider information in a hand drawn informal way to see the city. Learn about the history of a building, structure, establishment or park and what it has to offer. Locations and upcoming events that can’t be missed and visitors can post reviews about certain establishments.

Features:
* Categorized Listing of buildings on a map 
* Users can view pictures of the buildings on tapping on the building
* Registered users can write reviews
* Users can doodle on the building image and share it in social media
* Proper Authentication mechanism has been implemented.
* Zoom in and out of the map to take a closer look at the buildings.

Technical Features:
* Bitmap Region decoder has been used to show only regions of the map. We have used this to show high-resolution images. 
* The touch listeners are designed in such a way that it doesn't let the user zoom more than an extent. Helps to avoid the view of pixellated images.

Future Plans:
* Right now, given the short time duration to develop this app, we tried to keep things simple. So now we only have a local SQLite Database. But we have planned to move it to cloud Backend - most probably we will go with Parse for all of our server side needs. 

* Sharing on the social media feature is yet to be done.
